INTERNSHIP PROJECT – DATA ANALYSIS AND MACHINE LEARNING

PROJECT OVERVIEW
This project was developed as part of an internship program. The goal of the project is to analyze a real-world dataset, perform data preprocessing and exploratory analysis, and build a machine learning model to generate meaningful insights and predictions.

The project follows a complete data science workflow starting from data loading and cleaning to model training and evaluation.

OBJECTIVES
Understand the dataset and its structure
Perform exploratory data analysis
Clean and preprocess the data
Prepare features for modeling
Build and evaluate a machine learning model
Interpret results and findings

DATA ANALYSIS
Exploratory Data Analysis was performed to understand feature distributions, detect missing values, identify outliers, and study relationships between variables using visualizations and summary statistics.

DATA PREPROCESSING
Missing values were handled appropriately  
Categorical variables were encoded  
Numerical features were scaled  
Irrelevant features were removed  
Data was split into training and testing sets  

MODEL BUILDING
A machine learning model was trained using processed data. Model performance was evaluated using standard evaluation metrics suitable for the problem type.

RESULTS
The model achieved acceptable performance based on evaluation metrics. Insights from exploratory analysis helped improve data quality and model effectiveness.

CONCLUSION
This project provided hands-on experience with data analysis, preprocessing, and machine learning model development. It helped strengthen understanding of the end-to-end data science workflow.

FUTURE SCOPE
Use advanced machine learning algorithms  
Perform hyperparameter tuning  
Improve feature engineering  
Deploy the model for real-world use
